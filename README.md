**AadhaarPulse: Unlocking Societal Trends and Anomalies in Aadhaar Enrolment & Updates**

This repository contains the complete analytical workflow developed for **UIDAI Hackathon 2026**, focused on extracting meaningful societal insights and operational signals from Aadhaar demographic and biometric update datasets provided by UIDAI. The project demonstrates how large-scale government data can be cleaned, transformed, analyzed, and visualized to support informed decision-making and system-level improvements.

The analysis pipeline includes robust data ingestion and preprocessing, feature engineering of age-wise update metrics, and comprehensive univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis. Special emphasis is placed on temporal trend analysis and statistical anomaly detection to identify unusual monthly spikes and district-level hotspots that may indicate migration trends, service load imbalances, or infrastructure constraints.

The repository includes Jupyter notebooks with reproducible Python code, well-documented visualizations, and interpretable insights aligned with governance and policy needs. The methodology is scalable and adaptable, enabling future extensions such as predictive forecasting, real-time dashboards, or integration with additional Aadhaar-related datasets.

This project highlights the potential of Aadhaar data not only as an administrative record but as a strategic asset for evidence-based planning, proactive resource allocation, and improved citizen service delivery.
